Zodiac Pilot is a browser-based tool for Safe accounts that enables users to build and execute multi-step transactions across multiple dapps. It combines modular batching, programmable permissions, and a built-in sandbox environment to simulate transactions before theyâ€™re sent onchain. Designed to streamline treasury, governance, and DeFi workflows, Pilot reduces risk and coordination overhead by letting users manage execution directly from a side panel interface. [Available on the Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/zodiac-pilot/jklckajipokenkbbodifahogmidkekcb?hl=en&authuser=0)

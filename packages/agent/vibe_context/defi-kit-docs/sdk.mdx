# SDK

The SDK offers the functions of the DeFi Kit as a TypeScript library that can be installed from npm.
It is based on the [Roles SDK](https://github.com/gnosisguild/zodiac-modifier-roles/tree/main/packages/sdk).
We provide a browser-based [playground](/sdk-playground) to use the SDK for composing permissions in a programmatic way without the need to install anything.

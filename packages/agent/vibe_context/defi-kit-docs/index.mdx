# Overview

DeFi Kit is a set of carefully designed permissions covering interactions with DeFi protocols.
In combination with [Zodiac Roles](https://github.com/gnosisguild/zodiac-modifier-roles) they allow enforcing safe treasury management practices for funds held in a [Safe](https://safe.global).

Zodiac Roles is a Safe module that allows to define custom roles and assign them to addresses.
These accounts will then be able to make the Safe execute transactions within the scope of permissions granted to the role.

Defining permissions requires an intricate understanding of the underlying protocols and their security implications.
DeFi Kit helps in this endeavor by defining a set of [standard actions](/learn/actions) abstracting over implementation specific differences between protocols.
The [protocols catalogue](/learn/protocols) provides an overview of the supported protocols and their contract functions that are used by the standard actions.
